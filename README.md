# Easy Mesh Viewer [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

A simple gamedev tool for quick previewing mesh. Made with Godot Engine 3.2. By using a OpenGL graphic, you can quickly check how the mesh would look when it's in an actual game engine.

## Supported formats
Currently only support `<.obj>` files, planning on supporting `<.fbx>` and `<.gltf>` in the future.
